            The HSBC Women in Finance Mentoring Program is an annual mentoring program hosted in partnership with HSBC, to connect current female finance students with successful finance industry professionals. The program aims to provide an opportunity for female finance students to develop a close relationship and receive guidance from experienced and accomplished professionals, in planning and navigating a successful career in the finance industry.

                Students can gain valuable insight into what it is like in the finance professional and gain a lifelong mentor/friend to whom they can turn to, on not only professional issues and concerns, but also more personal problems in relation to working in a heavily male-dominated finance industry as a woman.
