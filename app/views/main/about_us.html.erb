<p><strong>Interesting Fact/Something Fun/What do you do in your spare time:</strong> I love FINSOC! Also, I like composing so from Year 10-12, I wrote 17 tracks and worked with friends to actually make an album happen. I'm glad I squeezed my first one out during the HSC so now I'm looking to write a piano album for myself. Other than that, I started off making videos for a YouTube channel, but now the videos I make are more personal. Something else I will always hold dear to me is Old School Runescape as it was a solid 80% of my childhood. In Year 7, I forcibly named my group  &#34Run Escape Tigers&#34 and in Year 12 I printed that onto a mousepad which I am using right now. In sum, I make videos, songs, albums and best friends. </p>
<p><strong>Your Favourite Thing About FINSOC:</strong> It's definitely a society where you can bring about the change you envision. As we help FINSOC grow, we inadvertently grow too. You've also got to be in it to experience the banter, memes, advice and stories. I'm loving the videos I have on my phone of NRMA meets FINSOC road trip. </p>
<p><strong>Why are you studying finance:</strong> Mathematics and theory is all good, but it's such a challenge to get to the level where real world experiences have gifted you the intuition to understand its practical applications. Being in a dynamic industry where ones 'gut feeling' never stops developing is a thrill and challenge I am ready to embrace.</p>

<p><strong>Interesting Fact/Something Fun/What do you do in your spare time:</strong> I like travelling to new places and doing hikes to get me closer to nature. When I'm not doing that, I like to watch travel vlogs! I also do salsa on Sundays.  </p>
